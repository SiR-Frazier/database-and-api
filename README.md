# Hot Dog Database API

An API that allows users to GET and POST reviews about various hot dog destinations around the world. Here are some user stories:

- [ ] As a user, I want to GET and POST reviews about hot dog destinations.
- [ ] As a user, I want to GET reviews by country or city.
- [ ] As a user, I want to see the most popular hot dog destinations by number of reviews or by overall rating.
- [ ] As a user, I want to PUT and DELETE reviews, but only if I wrote them. (I will start by requiring a user_name param to match the user_name of the author on the message. I will try authentication later.)
- [ ] As a user, I want to look up random destinations just for fun.
